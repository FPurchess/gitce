gitce - git continuous execution
=============================================================================

A simple shell-based, POSIX compliant continuous integration tool.



Basic Usage
=============================================================================

The core pattern this tool follows forces the codebase to have a single
executable which can decide if the current state of the code is ok or not.

This pattern is great for having a clean infrastructure and to use it with
"git bisect run" to find regressions fastly. The default executable gitce
searches is "test.sh". The return code decides if the test was successful
or not. 0 (zero) means success, everything else failure.

To use the gitce commands, you need to provide a configuration file with at
least the "REPOSITORY" entry which points to the source repository to check.

  Example:
      REPOSITORY=https://github.com/sarnowski/gitce


The tools will look at the following locations for the configuration file:

  As root:
      /etc/gitce/<CONFIGFILE>
  As user:
      $HOME/.gitce/<CONFIGFILE>

or you can specify the file directly. You can find an example configuration
with further explanation in the "examples" folder.
