gitce - git continuous execution
=============================================================================

A simple shell-based, POSIX compliant continuous integration tool.



Basic Usage
=============================================================================

The core pattern this tool follows forces the codebase to have a single
executable which can decide if the current state of the code is ok or not.

This pattern is great for having a clean infrastructure and to use it with
"git bisect run" to find regressions fastly. The default executable gitce
searches is "test.sh". The return code decides if the test was successful
or not. 0 (zero) means success, everything else failure.

To use the gitce commands, you need to provide a configuration file with at
least the "REPOSITORY" entry which points to the source repository to check.

  Example:
      REPOSITORY=https://github.com/sarnowski/gitce


The tools will look at the following locations for the configuration file:

  As root:
      /etc/gitce/<CONFIGFILE>
  As user:
      $HOME/.gitce/<CONFIGFILE>

or you can specify the file directly. You can find an example configuration
with further explanation in the "examples" folder:
  share/examples/example-project



Plugins
=============================================================================

To support build server specific environments it is possible to define hooks
which can setup and teardown the build environment or send notifications.
For more informations look at share/examples/hooks/README.

There are some prebuild hooks containing features like
  * Mail notifications
  * VNC server management



Web Interface
=============================================================================

gitce provides a simple web interface to track the current state of the build
server. To use it, you need a CGI capable web server. The following Apache2
configuration:

<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName tobi.cosmo

	DocumentRoot /usr/local/share/gitce
	<Directory />
		Options FollowSymLinks
		AllowOverride None
	</Directory>
	<Directory /usr/local/share/gitce/>
		Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
		AllowOverride None
		Order allow,deny
		allow from all
	</Directory>

	ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/local/share/gitce/cgi-bin/
	<Directory "/usr/local/share/gitce/cgi-bin">
		AllowOverride None
		Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Directory>
</VirtualHost>

WARNING: The web interface is highly exploitable and is not secure in any way
at the moment. The web interface will not provide any user management by
itself. Be sure to block any malicous sources. Only run it in your trusted
internal network or secure it by granting only access to trusted users.
