gitce - git continuous execution
=============================================================================

A simple shell-based continuous integration tool.



Basic Usage
=============================================================================

Your git repository must have an executable "test.sh" script in the root
directory. Typically a script you would give to "git bisect run". The return
code of the script measures if a build failed or worked.

To use the gitce commands, you need to provide a configuration file with at
least the "REPOSITORY" entry which points to the source repository to check.

  Example:
      REPOSITORY=https://github.com/sarnowski/gitce


The tools will look at the following locations for the configuration file:

  As root:
      /etc/gitce/<CONFIGFILE>
  As user:
      $HOME/.gitce/<CONFIGFILE>

or you can specify the file directly.


Running and checking with gitce
=============================================================================

$ gitce watch MyRepo

Will continuously check the repository for changes and automatically verify
them.


$ gitce run MyRepo master

Builds and checks the master branch.


$ gitce update

Updates the repository with the latest upstream changes.


$ gitce status

Shows all changes that need to be done.
